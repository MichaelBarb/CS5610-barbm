        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            I am working with Bootstrap this week.  I found a YouTube vidio that
            looks good am and trying it.  It can be found at:

            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I like about this is that it install Bootstrap into the project
            with source and documentation.  This will allow more experimentation with
            Bootstrap and to be better able to understand what it does.
        </p>
        <p>
            A complication of this is that it uses the .less files that need to be
            compiled.  It took me awhile to figure out I needed to install the Web
            Essential extention into Visual Studio.  This extension contains a lot of
            important aids for Visual Studio that all should have.
        </p>

            A couple of other things to note:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1. Loss of default margins and padding.  I added these quickly back
                for the body.
            </li>
            <li>
                2. The different from the browser default is the way the hyper links
                work.  It is now the same color as the text but responds to hover over.
            </li>
        </ul>
