        <h1>Page Cache</h1>
        <p>
            This is 2 experiments.  One was in Internet Explorer.  The other was in Chrome.
            There was a lot of research behind both of them.

        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <p>
            In debugging I am have some problems with the page being
            cached by the browser.&nbsp; Please note the following scenario.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Open site in Visual Studio debug.&nbsp; You are opening a local host.</li>
            <li>Open a page in the Story utility and find error.</li>
            <li>Close VS debug.</li>
            <li>Edit page and save. </li>
            <li>Open site in VS debug.</li>
            <li>Open page in story. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The old page is opened and not the revised one.&nbsp; You
            must hit the refresh button you will get the new one.
        </p>
        <p>
            This problem is not just in the story utility but applies to
            a web page.&nbsp; To insure you get the newer
            revision from the server and not the cached page I
            found the following solution:
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Internet Explorer:</h4>
        <p class="Indent1">
            Goto:&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools/Internet Options/General/Settings
        </p>
        <p>
            Under "Check for newer versions of stored pages:" you will
            find several radio buttons.
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1">
            Default is "Every time I start Internet Explorer".
        </p>
        <p class="Indent1">
            Change to Every time I visit a webpage"
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Chrome:</h4>
        <p>
            The problem noted in this thread also exists in
            Chrome.&nbsp; Chrome does not have a similar choice of when to check
            for&nbsp;newer versions.&nbsp; It always defaults to &quot;Every time I start
            Chrome&quot; There is an extension you can add&nbsp; "Page
            Monitor" It will at least notify you of changes.&nbsp; It still
            requires manual intervention so&nbsp;for&nbsp;our development purposes it is
            not as good as the Internet Explorer option.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all you Chrome lovers,
            here is a chance to make a simple extension to build a reputation for yourself.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Other Solutions:</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Meta Tags: &nbsp;</b> When you look around the web for answers to the problem of
            caching and updates there are several solutions that involve Meta tags.&nbsp;
            Many are out of date. They often do not work on all browsers, especially
            newer versions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>JavaScript: &nbsp;</b>There are other solution that involve JavaScript.&nbsp; I
            never found a good one but I am sure there must be one somewhere.

            Many different sites.  Some of the best answers were on
            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>.
            Still most of them really answered the question but gave me new search que's.

        <p>
            I posted a question
            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28439543/forcing-browser-refresh" target="_blank">Forcing Browser Refresh</a>
            in StackOverflow.  I have yet to get any good answers back.
