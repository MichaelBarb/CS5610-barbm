<h3>Site Up and Running</h3>

<p>
    I got the MasterPage source to display properly.  I ask a question on Piazza and Professor Rasala answered it.
    It has to do with the way the server provides files to $.ajax in showfile.htm
</p>
<p>
    There is an important distinction that need to be made:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>showfile.htm FOR .aspx                           -->  Server result after processing</li>
    <li>showfile.htm FOR .html .htm .css .js .txt .xml   -->  Source File</li>
    <li>fileview FOR all                                 -->  Source File</li>
</ul>
