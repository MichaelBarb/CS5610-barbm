<h4>jQuery UI</h4>

<p>
    This week I worked with an ASPX page and some asp controls.
</p>
<p>
    I also used jQuery and jQuery-ui on the page.  I used them only for there CSS files.  There were some differences when using in ASP that had to be dealt with.
</p>
<p>
    I found that asp validation did not work when ran from the school server.  I had to add validation to the code behind.

    To see the solution for the last set of experiments:
