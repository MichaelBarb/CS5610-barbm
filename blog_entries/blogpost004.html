<h4>Open HTML Pages</h4>

<p>
    Began working with way to open another web page.  This will be a critical 
    function as we build bigger sites and I wanted to insure I understood all 
    the implications.
</p>
<p>
    I searched the web to find ways to open the page in another window.  I 
    found there was not way in HTML but that Javascript has a method 
    window.open().  It can be put in a trival embedded script.  I studied and 
    explored the arguments for this method.
</p>
<p>
    Since we are required to have 5 experiments per week I divided the study 
    of opening a web page into 2 parts.
</p>
<p>
    We also needed to provide code snippets in the experiment reports.  I 
    worked out a method to display them in a box using a monospaced font.
