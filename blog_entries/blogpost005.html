<h4>TA Issues</h4>

<p>
    I did some updates per the request of the TA.
</p>
<ul>

    <li>1. Links to source code, i.e. File utility links are broken.    </li>
    <li>
        2. The documentation and source code should be in single file. In your
        Master Page experiment, I can see 5 entries for in story file which is
        not a proper way of documenting an experiment.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Regarding the second requirement:  In several of the other TA's websites
    they put the sorce code references in the story.  For this experiment I
    added them to the experiment page and left them in the story.
