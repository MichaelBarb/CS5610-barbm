<h4>Project Proposal</h4>

<p>
    I am taking robotics this semester also.  For my project I would like to provide an animated robot.
</p>
<p>
    The user will pick a target position and move the arm to that position.  Calcuating the angles for the robot arm is inverse kenomatices.
    The math and calculations for it is beyond what JavaScript can handle effiecently.  I am goin to do an ASP.NET web site.  This math will
    go back to the serve to be albe to do this calculation in compiled C#.  The final set of angles will be provided the web page and then
    using JavaScrip maninpulating the DOM will provide an animated move.
</p>
<p>
    This project takes web developement in a different direction from the database work most are doing.  It is concentrating on animating the
    display and not just replaying a sequence of pictures.  It will be much more responsive to size of the screen and provide an image that will
    be optimized for the size.
</p>
<p>
    Animation of a web page is still not well defined in the specs.  Most everything today consists of just streaming a video providing an
    illusion of an animated display.  Even many web based games just play back short videos.  
</p>
<p>
    A major problem with animation today is cross browser compatibility.  I am going to strive to maintain complatibility between IE and Chrome.
</p>
<p>
    If I can get to it I will provide a way for the user to save a series of points to a data base and have the robot play them back.
    Still, the main goal is provide scalable animation.
