<h3>Site Up and Running</h3>

<p>
    I got my site for this class up and running.
</p>

<p>
    My first chore is to work on my home page.  I plan on using a master form that can be used by experiments and my project site in the future.  It will use of CCS and several other features of ASP that we may not cover in this class.
</p>

<p>
    Following is a general introduction to the TA that will be monitoring my site for this class:
</p>

<p>
    I am an older engineer with over 30 years of experience.  My first degree right after
    high school was in mechanical engineering.
</p>

<p>
    I was working in factory automation.  They were putting more and more electronics into
    the machines.  There were no electrical engineers available and none of the older
    mechanical engineers wanted nothing to do with all this electronics junk.  Worse,
    some things were starting to be programed.  Being the young kid in the department I
    was given these parts of the projects.  Not really having the training for this I went
    back to night school for electrical engineering.  At that time there really was no
    computer science program.  Computer science was part of electrical engineering.
    I took most of my electives in software.
</p>

<p>
    For the past 25 years I have spent 25% of my time doing electrical hardware, 25% sales
    and project management, and 50% software.
</p>

<p>
    My degrees no longer reflect what I do and are kind of a disadvantage.  I had the
    opportunity to go for a master’s degree in computer science and took it.  I was not
    sure I would survive the first year.  I now have only 1 course left after this
    semester.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the work I have done has been in the Microsoft technology stack.  I have
    extensive experience with Visual Studio doing C++, Basic, .NET and C#.  I have done
    both Windows Forms and WPF’s.  It is a massive program.  By lines of code VS is one
    of the 10 largest programs ever written.  I have used very little of it.  I do not
    think anyone has really used that much.  I have not done web design, HTML, ASP, or
    JavaScript in it or anything.  I have done a few static websites and small amount of
    HTML for them.  I really look forward to this class.
