<h4>Bootstrap</h4>

<p>
    AI am working with Bootstrap this week.  I found a YouTube vidio that
    looks good am and trying it.  It can be found at:

    Visual Studio 2013 Bootstrap Quick Start
</a>
<p>
    One thing I like about this is that it install Bootstrap into the project
    with source and documentation.  This will allow more experimentation with
    Bootstrap and to be better able to understand what it does.
</p>
<p>
    A complication of this is that it uses the .less files that need to be
    compiled.  It took me awhile to figure out I needed to install the Web
    Essential extention into Visual Studio.  This extension contains a lot of
    important aids for Visual Studio that all should have.

<ul>

    <li>1. Links to source code, i.e. File utility links are broken.    </li>
    <li>
        2. The documentation and source code should be in single file. In your
        Master Page experiment, I can see 5 entries for in story file which is
        not a proper way of documenting an experiment.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Regarding the second requirement:  In several of the other TA's websites
    they put the sorce code references in the story.  For this experiment I
    added them to the experiment page and left them in the story.
