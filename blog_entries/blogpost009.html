<h4>jQuery UI</h4>

<p>
    I started working with jQuery UI and its formating features.  In general they are nearly as
    nice as those in Bootstrap.  There advantage is that the page loads much faster.
</p>
<p>
    I first tied some buttons with Icons.  I tried the Button Demo on the jQuery UI web site.
    I could get the buttons to work with their different formatting but could the icons to display.
    Tracing it back I found that they save all there buttons in a single file.  There are several
    of these files depending on what color the icon is to be.  The then extract an area of this
    file for each icon.  It probably makes download faster but Visual Studio complains that it is slow.
</p>
<p>
    It is also picky about where the images are located.  The file “jquery-ui.css” expects to
    find a sub-folder located in the same folder it is located in called icons.  This relationship
    is not documented and took considerable time to figure out.
</p>
<p>
    To find the icon you want to use can be difficult.  I found a web page “Find the jQuery UI
    you want” which nicely organizes them and makes them more searchable.
</p>
<p>
    I did not like the default color scheme.  I went to the jQuery and generated new scheme.
    I started with the gallery scheme Cupertino and got rid of all the gradients and patterned
    backgrounds. When you down load this theme you are really downloading a custom copy of
    jQuery UI.  It modifies the images and puts all the changes in “jquery-ui.css”.  It also gives
    you a file “jquery-ui.theme.css” with your setting in case you want to edit them further.
</p>

    To see the solution that I ended up with see the experiment:
