<h4>Bootstrap</h4>

<p>
    In previous experiments I had tried several things to build a good home page.  I could never get a look and feel that
    looked professional.  In particular I found js-ui very disappointing.  Bootstrap was able to give me the look I was after
    so I am trying an experiment to see how it will work.

    I started with the example from the Kindle book referenced.  This provided an example of a full featured responsive web page.

<p>
    In total I was very pleased with the results.
