<h4>jQuery</h4>

<p>
    In trying to do all the updates to Git and the server I forgot to work on
    the blog.  Following is a summary of the week’s work.
<p>
    Bootstrap wants to use jQuery.  The install of Bootstrap included jQuery
    version 1.9.0.  Bootstrap was picky and gave me an error when running in
    VS debug. From the schools server this error does not show up.  Last weeks
    experiments dealt with CSS.  I was not using the JavaScript features of
    Bootstrap and commented these lines out of the HTML.
</p>
<p>
    This week I worked on this error.  It seemed like Bootstrap gave me the
    error no matter what version of jQuery I used.  I.  I also demonstrated
    this to both the professor and TA and neither of us could understand why
    we still got an error no matter what version of jQuery we used.  I was able
    to demonstrate it in both Chrome and Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
    For experiments I developed 3 version of the Bootstrap page each calling a
    different version of jQuery.  Only the 1.9.0 version gave me an error.
</p>
<p>
    While working on the 3 versions I notice that other things on the pages
    we’re not always updating.  I began investigating how the browser did
    caching or buffering of web pages.  I found it to be a problem experienced
    by many others.  Most interesting was that many of the fixes that worked
    years ago do not work in the current versions of browsers.
</p>
<p>
    I posted a question on Piazza and got an unsatisfying answer but it did
    confirm some of my suspicions.
</p>

    To see the solution that I ended up with see the experiment:
